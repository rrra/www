### Subscribe to the RRRA Club Discussions electronic mailing list { #subscribe }

The RRRA Club Discussions electronic mailing list is our primary
non-radio means of group communication. Once your subscription is
approved you will be able to start, or participate in, discussion
with all of the other mailing list subscribers by sending e-mail to
rrra@lists.rrra.org

#### A couple of points to remember:

:star: We respect our members' privacy

: so your e-mail address will ***NOT*** be visible to other list
subscribers ***unless*** you post a message to the list.

:star: You can't send files 

: such as documents and photos through our mailing lists. Use our
[groupware system] when you want to share files with others.

:star: Replies to messages go to everyone

: (a sort of automatic "reply-all"). If you wish to reply privately
to someone it is your responsibility to edit the "To:" header on your
reply.

:star: You are in complete control

: of your mailing list subscription(s). Our mailing list manager
provides an easy to use web interface which allows you update or
change your e-mail address, control your subscription settings, and
even unsubscribe at will. Please take advantage of these self service
features to manage your subscription(s).

#### How to subscribe
