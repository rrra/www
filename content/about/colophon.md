This website serves both both our club members and prospective hams
by providing easy access to current club information and other
hobby-related content in a device independent and highly performant
manner, and by demonstrating that our club is an active organization.

**No AI is used for site development / maintenance or to create locally
authored content.**

Our website's look and feel is based on the [Twenty Fourteen template]
by [jaden]. Twenty Fourteen is a [responsive], two-column Hugo theme
based on the [Wordpress theme] of the same name.

Our website is generated with [Hugo]; a fast and modern static website
engine written in the [Go Programming Language]. For site resilience and
maintainer accessibility the source---both structure and content---is
managed with [git] and is stored in a [public GitHub repository]. We
welcome additions, updates, and corrections via a [pull request] or via
email to the {{< webmaster >}}.

Except as noted below the *Antipixel* (80x15) web-badges used on this
site are &copy;2012--{{< year >}} {{< mailto K0STK >}} and are based on
[Adam Kalsey's Button Maker].

This website features a [Blank Page] to commemorate the [TPILB-Project].
