## What is Ham Radio?

Amateur Radio (ham radio) is a popular hobby and service that brings
people, electronics and communication together. People use ham radio to
talk across town, around the world, or even into space, all without the
Internet or cell phones. It's fun, social, educational, and can be a
lifeline during times of need.

## Who is the Typical Ham?

Amateur Radio operators come from all walks of life ... doctors,
students, kids, politicians, truck drivers, movie stars, missionaries
and even your average neighbor next door. They are of all ages, sexes,
income levels and nationalities. Whether through Morse Code on an
old brass telegraph key, voice communication on a hand-held radio or
computerized messages transmitted via satellite, all hams use radio to
reach out to the world.

## Why should I get licensed?

**You need to be licensed before you can get on the air so that you
know the rules to operate safely and legally.** US licenses are
good for 10 years before renewal and anyone may hold one except a
representative of a foreign government. In the US there are three
license classes---Technician, General and Extra. The [ARRL Getting
Licensed page](http://www.arrl.org/getting-licensed) describes the
license classes and provides useful links for those interested in
becoming licensed.
