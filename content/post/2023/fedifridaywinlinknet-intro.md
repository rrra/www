Improving any skill takes practice. Amateur radio operators who use
[Winlink Global Radio Email](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winlink)
(AKA Winlink) have an opportunity to practice every Friday by checking
in to the
[#FediFridayWinlinkNet](https://coloradodigital.net/nets/fedifridaywinlinknet/).
<!--more-->

Check-in messages may be sent via any method supported by the Winlink system:
HF, VHF, APRS, Telnet, ...

The general procedure is to send a Winlink message on Friday between
0000Z and 2359Z to the NCS with the following format:

```
To: [NCS callsign]
Subject: FFWN
Message body line1: [callsign], [firstname], [city],
[state/province/locale], [country], [mastodon username], [VHF/HF/APRS/Telnet]
Message body line2: [an open question determined by each week's NCS]
```

The details for each weekly net are posted on Mastodon shortly before
0000 UTC on Friday and may be found by searching for the
[#FediFridayWinlinkNet](https://mastodon.radio/tags/fedifridaywinlinknet)
hashtag on any instance.

A Mastodon account is not required to search for net details, but is highly
recommended to interact *out of band* with the other net participants. Visit
[joinmastodon.org](https://joinmastodon.org/) to learn more about joining
Mastodon and for a list of apps.

Results for each weekly net are posted on the
[Colorado Digital Multiproticol #FediFridayWinlinkNet page](https://coloradodigital.net/nets/fedifridaywinlinknet/)
