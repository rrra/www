Throughout my previous career in public safety and even with my
continued involvement in emergency management, there have always been
continuing education requirements. Theories were always evolving,
new modalities were introduced, and new specialties were emerging.
Continuing education was a way to make sure those who needed to
know...knew.

Amateur radio does not have any such requirements.

If you have been involved in amateur radio for any length of time, you
have undoubtedly seen some changes occur. The huge strides made in
amateur radio equipment have been astounding. I look across my shack at
the Yaesu FT-101EE and a few thoughts hit me.

First, it still works and works well for what it is. I fire it up about
once a month and check in to a net or two just to keep the dust off the
tubes.

Additionally, I learned a lot about electronics theory and practice by
maintaining and operating this radio.

Then I jump to the other end of the station where my [Yaesu FTDX-101MP]
sits. It really shows the limitations of the FT-101EE. The dual
receivers, VC-Tune, and phenomenal filtering make it a true joy to
operate. I have a Yaesu FTDX-10 and a couple of Barrett 2050s that fall
at various points along the spectrum in between.

The point is, as the technology changes, I have to pursue further
education to keep up.

Next, let's look at the new protocols that have come about. We can
talk about [DMR], which is not new but fairly new to amateur radio. It
is an old Motorola product that has been adapted by the amateur radio
community. We can throw in P25 and NXDN as protocols that started out
in the commercial realm and were adapted. Then we have [D-STAR] and [C4FM
\(System Fusion\)] that are strictly amateur radio protocols.

[C4FM \(System Fusion\)]: https://www.dxengineering.com/search?SortBy=BestKeywordMatch&SortOrder=Ascending&keyword=C4FM

These protocols are not difficult to use. That being said, some of them
require a sharp learning curve to make them work. I have not found many
operators, if any, who can program DMR repeaters into a handheld without
the aid of a programming software package. These are great tools, but if
I am going to be proficient in their use, I have to invest the time in
learning their ins and outs.

Then there are the digital modes---RTTY, Packet, PSK31, and FT4/FT8 to
name a few.

Each one has a specific software package that lets users jump in the
pool. These modes allow for the transfer of data or messages over the
air from computer to computer. It is great to know that if I need to
send an email in an "infrastructure down" event, I have the ability
to do so. It"s why I have taken the time to learn how.

And that leads us to computers. Nowadays we not only need to know how
to operate our radios, but we also need to be computer gurus as well.
Let's face it, we can go to bed tonight with everything working and
wake up tomorrow and it won't even power on. That's how it seems
to go with me. Just earlier today, I was working with a customer and a
monitor went dark. Right before my eyes it died and was not responsive
to defibrillation.

Another rabbit hole I fell down recently is 3D printing. It is amazing
how many gadgets I didn't know I needed before I got a 3D printer.
I can now connect my TH-D72A and my phone right on the handle of my
Arrow handheld satellite antenna. And I now have at least one HT
holder in every room of the house. Plus, getting into 3D printing to
support my amateur radio hobby forced me to learn computer-aided design
(CAD)---just beginning this one.

You get the picture. One thing leads to another, which leads to another
and so on. Sure, I could just sit contently in the shack and make phone
contacts on the ole 101EE, but look at what I would be missing.

For me, the learning is fun, but even more enjoyable is passing on the
knowledge to others. Hopefully by learning some new things, I can help
inspire a new generation in a way that interests them
**while not forcing them to like what I like...and how I like it.**
