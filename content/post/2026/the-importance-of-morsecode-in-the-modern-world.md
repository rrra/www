Even in today's world we still need people that ... know morsecode.
Because when all things fail we will go back to the basics. Morsecode
is that basic thing in communication. You can do it with very simple
equipment or no equipment at all as long as you know the language.

This video---from the [NSA Youtube Channel]---shows a great antenna
and a way of direction finding from the cold war era. It also features the
importance of morsecode in the military, even today. Although the video
is 5 years old it still is relevant.
