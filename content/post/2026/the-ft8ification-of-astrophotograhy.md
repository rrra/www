We often hear how FT8 has automated the QSO, depersonalizing it by
letting a computer do all the work.

This process is evident not just in ham radio --- you probably know
of several other equivalent examples in other aspects of hobbies and
industry.

In 2018, the first "smart telescope" was produced. It was called the
[Stellina] and it produced low-resolution images. The cost: $4000.

What makes a smart telescope smart? 

* It has built-in GPS and compass to know where it is and roughly where
it is looking
* It is controlled entirely by an app on your smartphone 
* It has the night sky map built into it for "[plate solving]". IOW,
it takes a photo, compares that photo to a known skymap, and therefore
knows exactly what corrections to make to go where you want it to go
* It then tracks the desired target with precise accuracy as it
photographs the target for minutes or hours
* Individual exposures (from 10-60 seconds each) are then stacked,
allowing noise to be subtracted and detail to emerge

Prior to 2018, all of these steps required separate pieces of equipment
with interconnecting cables. Each piece of gear had its own set-up
procedure and the resulting images of a nightlong session were stacked,
by the sleepy astrophotographer, the next morning.

Smart telescopes are now pocket-able and cost as low as $350 -- $200
if you're local and want to buy my mint [S30] (I have a new [S30 Pro]
incoming). They are the FT8 of astrophotography and anyone can learn to
use one in about 20 minutes.

A detailed image that used to require months of dedicated practice and
$$$$$ in equipment costs can now be obtained casually and inexpensively
by a beginner on their first clear night.

Being so easy, is it fulfilling?

Yes, but in a different way.

Old-school astrophotographers are often as dismissive of smart scopes as
old hams sometimes are of FT8.

They've invested time and money into their craft and now technology
comes along that makes their accomplishments accessible to rookies.

What makes a smart scope appealing to me is its simplicity-to-output
factor. It sets up in minutes, weighs 3.5lbs/1.6kg and is about the size
of James Michener's [Hawaii].

**But the best part is --- like FT8 --- it's a great way to introduce a
niche hobby to those who otherwise wouldn't be exposed to it.**
