... to Compare Real-World Contacts with Propagation Predictions.

February 20, 2026 — [DXLook.com] has released two new composite map
views designed to help amateur radio operators compare actual on-air
results with propagation expectations in one place. The update adds
Reports + MUF and Reports + VOACAP, allowing operators to see where
signals are being reported versus where models suggest they should
propagate—without switching between separate tools or screens.

### New Composite Views

Reports + MUF
: This view overlays real contact reports (solid arcs) on top of MUF
(Maximum Usable Frequency) zones. The colored zones represent the
highest usable band by direction, helping operators quickly confirm
whether contacts align with expected openings and identify unusual paths
such as grey-line effects, sporadic-E, or long-path propagation.

Reports + VOACAP
: This view overlays real contact reports (solid lines) with VOACAP
theoretical predictions (dashed, semi-transparent arcs). It provides a
direct side-by-side visual comparison between model-based expectations
and real-world activity, making it easier to spot agreement, gaps, and
surprises.

How to Access
: Operators can try the new views by visiting dxlook.com, selecting
Reports + MUF or Reports + VOACAP from the View dropdown, then entering
a callsign or grid square and clicking Go.

### Update Details

* The MUF/VOACAP prediction backdrop refreshes every 5 minutes
independently
* Reports refresh based on the selected time window (1 minute to 24
hours)
* Existing Reports features remain available, including filters for
band/mode/direction, marker options, and the spot table

DXLook.com is free to use, requires no login, and aggregates data from
PSK Reporter, Reverse Beacon Network (RBN), WSPRnet, and DX Cluster,
supporting bands from 160m through 2m.

### About DXLook.com
