RRRA needs an Election Manager for the club's
[2026 Officer Elections]({{< relref "/calendar/2026/february-meeting.md">}}).

Filling the position of Election Manager is a great way for a club
member to make a crucial contribution towards ensuring our club's
successful operation without taking on a long term leadership commitment.

The Election Manager is responsible for:

* Ensuring there is a candidate for each office / position
* Soliciting and collecting the votes during the election meeting
* Ensuring that any ballots used are counted impartially
* Submitting an election report to the board presidemt

Please contact the {{< mailto president >}} to volunteer for the position of
Election Manager.
