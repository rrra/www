With the recent introduction of [Priority Areas for Funding][priority],
ARDC is especially interested in projects that align with the following
areas:

Research & Development (R&D):
: open hardware and software systems that enable learning and
experimentation (e.g. SDRs, open codec technologies, new modulation
techniques).

Space-Based Communications:
: projects that create or expand access to satellite communications for
amateur radio (AR) and digital communications (DC), engaging communities
in wireless experimentation (e.g. GEO or HEO programs, repurposed
commercial satellites, space-based tools for learning).

Open Source Education:
: scalable, open educational materials and hands-on projects that make
AR and DC more accessible, especially for new learners and clubs (e.g.
curricula, videos).

ARDC welcomes proposals across the full range of amateur radio and
digital communications, but projects that align with these areas remain
a priority. Learn more about [applying for grants][apply] at ARDC.
