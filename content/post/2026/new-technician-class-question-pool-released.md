The National Conference of Volunteer Examiner Coordinators ([NCVEC])
Question Pool Committee (QPC) released the revised 2026-2030 Technician
Class (Element 2) question pool on December 18, 2025. It will be
required for all exam sessions beginning 1st July 2026.
<!--more-->

The new pool includes 409 questions (27 new, 30 removed, and about 155
modified), compared to 412 in the prior pool. The pool also includes
three diagrams used for some of the questions.

This updated question pool incorporates significant changes compared to
the prior pool. The questions were checked for technical accuracy and
relevance to current amateur radio practices, as well as for grammar,
syntax, format, clarity, and for redundancy within and between the
pools.

VECs and Volunteer Examiners must use test designs based on the new
pool starting on 1st July 2026. Current ARRL VEC Technician Class exam
booklets (2022 series) and computer-generated Technician Class exams
created from the 2022 question pool are valid until 30th June 2026.
After that, old versions should be destroyed.

ARRL will have new editions of Technician Class study materials,
including The ARRL Ham Radio License Manual, Gordon West Technician
Class License Prep book, and ARRL’s Tech Q&A, by May 2026.
