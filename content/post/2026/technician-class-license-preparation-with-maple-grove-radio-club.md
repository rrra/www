The technician class license is the required entry-level license for
ham radio operators. You earn the technician class license by passing one
examination of 35 questions on radio theory, regulations and operating
practices. This license gives access to all Amateur Radio frequencies
above 30 megahertz, allowing these licensees the ability to communicate
locally and most often within North America. It also allows for some
limited privileges on the HF (also called "short wave") bands used
for international communications.
