ARRL The National Association for Amateur Radio&reg; reports that the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted changes to its rules to
require that every holder of an FCC Registration Number (FRN) update
their contact information in the [CORES] system (email and postal
addresses) within ten business days of a change.

[CORES]: https://apps.fcc.gov/cores/userLogin.do

Because every FCC licensee—including amateur radio operators—must
have an FRN to file applications, this requirement applies to all
licensed amateurs. FRN contact information is handled separately and
apart from contact information related to a license in the [License
Manager System]. Both records must be kept up-to-date, and each requires
a separate update.

[License Manager System]: https://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsEntry/licManager/login.jsp

Until now, no specific deadline existed for updating FRN or license
contact information. Instead, the amateur rules at sections 97.21
and 97.23 provide that a license may be suspended or revoked "if FCC
correspondence is returned as undeliverable because of an incorrect
address/email." These provisions remain in effect as well as the 10-day
deadline applicable to FRN information.

If your FRN information is current and has not changed, no immediate
action is required, but you must adhere to the 10-day rule for future
changes. It is recommended to periodically check both the [CORES] and
[License Manager Systems] to ensure contact information is accurate,
even if no changes have occurred.

The new deadline (section 1.8002(b)(2) of the Commission's Rules)
became effective on February 5 as part of a proceeding that was limited
to further constraining robocalls. Although the proceeding focused on
robocall issues, the 10-day update requirement applies broadly to all
FRN holders. On February 6 the FCC confirmed in a Public Notice that
the new deadline applies to all FRN holders. The amendment replaces
language adopted in 2001 that required FRN holders to keep their contact
information up-to-date but had not imposed a deadline for doing so.

Numerous requests for clarification from non-robocaller interests led
the FCC to issue a [Public Notice on February 6][notice] \([see also
PDF][pdf]\) clarifying that fines imposed on those subject to the
robocall rules for not keeping contact information up-to-date do NOT
apply to licensees such as radio amateurs, but that the 10-day deadline
does apply to all FRN holders.
