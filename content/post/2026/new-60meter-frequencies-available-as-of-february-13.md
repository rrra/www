The new 60-meter frequencies approved by the FCC in December will become
available to amateurs as of February 13, 2026 (0000 UTC), along with
new power restrictions on those frequencies. It's a bit confusing, as
different rules apply to different segments of the band. The changes
result from the [FCC's action to approve][action] a worldwide 60-meter
amateur allocation made by the World Radiocommunication Conference in
2015 (WRC-15).

As of February 13, FCC-licensed amateur operators holding General Class
or higher licenses may operate on a secondary basis anywhere between
5351.5 and 5366.5 kHz, subject to a maximum bandwidth of 2.8 kHz and
maximum transmit power of 9.15 watts ERP (effective radiated power).
For the purpose of computing ERP, the transmitter PEP (peak envelope
power) is multiplied by the antenna gain relative to a half-wave
dipole antenna. A half-wave dipole is presumed to have a gain of 1 (0
dBd). Amateurs using other antennas must maintain in their station
records either the antenna manufacturer's data on the antenna gain or
calculations of the antenna gain.

Here's the confusing part: The existing 60-meter channels centered on
5332, 5348, 5373, and 5405 kHz remain as secondary amateur allocations
with maximum power of 100 watts ERP. However, the old channel at 5358.5
kHz is eliminated as it is now part of the new 5351.5--5366.5 kHz
subband and subject to the lower power limit.

For all 60-meter transmissions, emission bandwidth is limited to 2.8
kHz or less and amateurs must not cause harmful interference to, and
must accept interference from, stations authorized by the United States
(NTIA and FCC) and other nations in the fixed service; and all other
nations in the mobile service (except aeronautical mobile). Data or RTTY
emissions in particular must be limited in transmission length so as not
to cause harmful interference. Digital mode operators must be familiar
with offsets in order to stay within the authorized frequencies.
