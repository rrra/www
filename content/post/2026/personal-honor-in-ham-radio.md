There are some unspoken things that a ham radio operator aspires
towards.

Personal Honor is a big one.
<!--more-->

Meeting that Personal Honor isn’t hard. It involves operating within
the rules & norms, putting courtesy & honesty at the top, being a
willing & effective Elmer teaching others, and being proactive in
adjusting/correcting parts of your amateur radio efforts that fall short
of those goals.

It includes affording the respect of other Hams, and offering them
solutions to any perceived shortcomings that arise.

Personal Honor also includes a respect for things non-ham, including
striking a balance between radio & non-radio.
