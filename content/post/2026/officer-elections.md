Officers and a Board of Directors are essential to the operation of
the Red River Radio Amateurs.

And our club owes a debt of gratitude to those who have stepped forward
to fill these leadership positions.

But we can not continue to depend upon the same few individuals year
after year. It is well past time for new officers to step forward from
within our membership.

As specified in 
[Article III]({{< relref "/about/bylaws.md#article-iii-fiscal-year" >}}) of the
[RRRA Bylaws]({{< relref "/about/bylaws.md" >}}),
a leadership election will be conducted during the
[February Meeting]({{< relref "/calendar/2026/february-meeting.md" >}}).
