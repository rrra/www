Modes like Olivia, JS8call and PSK31 offer a great opportunity to
communicate non-verbally but still personally. It could be the perfect
way to enjoy ham radio as an introvert or as a ham with a sub-optimal
antenna situation in a way that it's still a personal communication

<!--more-->

When I started amateur radio in 2019, I initially only considered FT8
and FT4, as it is a very simple and straightforward way to get into
the hobby --- also because I still was very mic shy. I was already
experimenting with other digi modes like PSK31 and RTTY, but my main
goal was to work as many countries on as many bands as possible and as
quickly as possible. To achieve this, FT8 and FT4 are very suitable and
have been instrumental in achieving first the DXCC and later the WAS
award.

However, for various reasons, I have [recently decided to distance
myself from working new DXCC entities and focus on the person behind
the station I am working](https://dk1mi.radio/on-qsling/). FT8 is
therefore of not much use and I now mainly use it for general tests or
QRP experiments. Since I don't know CW, the only thing left is SSB or
the (for me) forgotten keyboard to keyboard digi modes.

One of the biggest hurdles for me was to get
[Fldigi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fldigi) (a very popular open
source for Digital Modes in Amateur Radio) working together with
[Quisk](https://james.ahlstrom.name/quisk/) (Python based SDR software
for the Hermes Lite 2 transceiver amongst others). [Now that I have
managed to do this](https://dk1mi.radio/quisk-fldigi/), I have finally
been able to try out various alternative digi modes again.

I was actually mainly interested in newer modes like Olivia, Contestia
or Thor, but unfortunately there seems to be less activity here.
However, I was able to make many nice QSOs in PSK31 in the last few
days. Most of them were rather macro-based and comparable to the mouse
to mouse FT8 experience, but a few were actually real keyboard to
keyboard conversations. Interestingly, these 30-40 minute ragchews were
all DX QSOs.

I find it absolutely fascinating to be able to make longer
intercontinental conversations with just a little power and even in less
than ideal conditions. You have a lot more time to think during the
conversation as it would be in SSB, which is very helpful if you're not
talking/typing in your native language. I used a mixture of macros and
manual keystrokes to automate, for example, the beginning of each pass
or the transitions to the other station, but also longer blocks of text
such as the station description.

But even with macro-based QSOs you learn much more about the person on
the other side than in any FT8 or in most SSB QSOs. It was the latter
in particular that I realized with regret. SSB remains my main mode,
but I have now found a functioning alternative mode that meets my
requirements.

I would like others to give the many different keyboard to keyboard
modes available a chance. I keep reading about younger radio amateurs
who don't dare to try SSB and prefer to communicate via the computer and
then use FT8.
