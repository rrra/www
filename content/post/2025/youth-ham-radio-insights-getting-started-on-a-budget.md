Amateur radio isn't the easiest hobby for young people to pursue for
a multitude of reasons, including the support needed to get one's
footing in the hobby. One of the most challenging factors for youth
wishing to get involved with amateur radio is the financial investment.
However, this challenge can definitely be overcome.

If you are a young ham struggling to get into amateur radio because of
the expenses or simply want to explore more of the hobby before making a
large financial commitment, there are plenty of low- or no-cost options
to help you get started.

The first---and lowest-cost option---is to borrow equipment. This could
be from a mentor, another local ham, or perhaps even a club. Many clubs
have a few pieces of equipment that can be borrowed by their members
(particularly younger ones), and some even have fully assembled stations
to lend.

For example, my school club started with an older HF radio as the
set club station. After receiving a donation of another radio, we
decided that rather than have two radios in the permanent station
setup, it would be more worthwhile to use one of the radios as part of
a station to lend to students who have just gotten their [General] or
[Extra] licenses. To complete this "lender station," we purchased
an inexpensive power supply and a simple dipole at a hamfest so club
members wouldn't need too much of their own equipment in the setup.

My school's club also has a few VHF and UHF radios to be lent to
students, along with corresponding antennas. Students who pass their
[Technician] exams are given a handheld transceiver upon receiving their
callsigns, so the VHF and UHF setups are not as frequently borrowed as
the HF station. Students typically borrow this equipment over holiday
breaks during the school year and summer break since we have a permanent
station at the school that is open for them to use.

Another way to save money on equipment is to "borrow" it remotely. Some
local clubs have remote-capable stations that you could use, and if
not (or in addition to that!), [Remote Ham Radio \(RHR\)][RHR] has a
free membership for young hams, allowing you to use their select youth
stations which are graciously put on the air by other users of the
software. All you need to use the RHR youth console is a device that has
a supporting browser and a good internet connection, making RHR a very
accessible option.

[EchoLink] is another online way to get on the air. Although it is only
for VHF and UHF, you can still check into nets and use repeaters that                         0

If you're looking to start your own station rather than borrowing
or using online equipment, there are a few good lower-cost options
both for buying new and previously owned equipment. As I noted when
discussing my school's equipment for loan, we purchased a few pieces
of equipment at local hamfests. These hamfests can be a good place to
purchase previously owned equipment for significant discounts, though
they can be rather "hit or miss," so it may take some effort to find
exactly what you need.

While not as low-cost as the options I've mentioned, buying and
building kits is also a significantly less expensive possibility
than simply buying a radio. Lots of kits exist for small HF radios,
particularly for CW, and you can quickly and inexpensively build
a CW key with household materials. Antennas can also be easily
"homebrewed" (built yourself) from materials that you probably
already have around your house, like speaker wire and lamp cord. A large
part of amateur radio is the spirit of building and designing your
own equipment. Getting creative is not only a good way to save some
money, but it can also lead you to the sub-community of amateur radio
operators who love experimenting with the technical side of the hobby.

>(soldering required).

There are numerous ways to get involved with amateur radio on a budget,
from borrowing equipment to building it. More importantly than where the
equipment comes from, have fun getting on the air!
