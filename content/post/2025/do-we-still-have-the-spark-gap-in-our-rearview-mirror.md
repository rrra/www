**Change has pulls and tugs toward the past and forward into the future**

We hear the word culture bandied about all the time. It means different
things to different people. Social scientists define it as follows:

>Culture includes the shared belief systems, rituals, and conversational
>styles of small groups, as well as societally pervasive ways of seeing
>that are passed from generation to generation. Culture is anything
>created by the mind, hand, or mouth of humans. [^2]

One thing I've observed about amateur radio in the U.S. is that culture
has a strong pull towards the past. We often hear this coming out when
hams begin some comment with their "tenure" in the hobby: "Well, I've
been licensed X years and I know..." Substitute your own number of years
for X in this sentence. The listener is supposed to genuflect to this
tenure in the hobby as containing superior knowledge and wisdom. Social
linguists call this "indexicality" to indicate what reference is being
used in the argument. (For bench testers, think "reference plane" in a
VNA calibration.) So many amateurs "index" their understanding of the
hobby relative to when they were first licensed, especially if it was
during their teen years. That understanding "indexes" everything that
comes afterwards and results in much of the verbal conflict on the air
and on social media. Or, in person, to the astute observer at hamfests,
lol.

The power that such indexicality has on the hobby is related to the
demographic *composition* of amateur radio at this time. The demographer
Ron Lesethage [documented] how the age composition of a population is
related to the values for having children, a predicate for population
replacement. In most all developed countries, child-bearing age women
no longer see giving birth as an important part of their future. This
is a clear historical change with respect to how they define what is
important in their lives as women, unlike their mothers and women in
most previous age cohorts. This "index" by women in developed countries
is an example of *the power that these belief benchmarks have on society*.
With the dominance of Baby Boomers in the hobby, is it any wonder why
the view of of technology by many hams is much closer to the Spark Gap
than it is, say, using digital modes like FT8?

### What does this have to do with a [Spark Gap] transmitter?

[spark gap]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spark-gap_transmitter

It is a *metaphorical reference* point to the technological origins
of the wireless which, by definition, was amateur in nature. If we
consider an automobile as the ham collectivity passing through time, at
what point ***should*** the Spark Gap transmitter leave our rearview
mirror as a guidepost? Is that vision a stifling tug against our speed
toward what is visible through our front windshield? Many historians and
innovators say yes it is. Here's an AI-assisted image to illustrate what
I mean.

{{< figure src="https://k4fmh.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Is-the-Spark-Gap-Still-in-Our-Rearview-Mirror-e1760559276490.png" caption="Is the Spark Gap Still in Our Rearview Mirror?&nbsp;" attr="K4MFH" attrlink="https://k4fmh.com/2025/10/15/do-we-still-have-the-spark-gap-in-our-rearview-mirror/" >}}

So many new innovations are visible before us. But so many index our
progress against the earlier periods more adjacent to the ancient Spark
Gap transmitter. This is a continuum, of course, but listen to the
naysayer commentaries on recent innovation. *Why* are they "bad" for
the hobby? Are they "killing" amateur radio? I've [noted previously]
that change is often labeled as pending death to those *whose indexed
standards are in decline*. Right now, it's those of the Baby Boomers
as they hold positions of power and influence in the hobby while they
progress toward Silent Key status. In a decade or more, it won't be.

[noted previously]: https://k4fmh.com/2025/01/22/the-u-s-ham-radio-market-is-it-dying/

Remembering the cultural origins of an activity like ham radio should
become history at some point. That is, every new initiate shouldn't
be held to norms of beginning at the beginning. It is thought that an
***overemphasis*** on history can stifle innovation. This doesn't mean
that history should be forgotten. This is not a binary argument. Quite
the contrary, there is a balance and a place for history. New initiates
into the hobby shouldn't be pushed toward the historical beginning but
acquire it as part of the present and immediate future's innovation. The
latter is often what draws newcomers to the hobby space.

>Innovation has many enemies; one of them is experience. Experience is
>often lauded as a critical component of expertise and wisdom. Indeed,
>without experience, it's hard to imagine how one would navigate the
>intricacies of business, science, or even day-to-day life. However,
>in the context of innovation, experience can sometimes serve as a
>double-edged sword. While it may offer a solid foundation, experience
>can also limit one's vision, restricting innovative thought. [^1]

### What does an emphasis on the past do for progress?

There are several elements to the detriment of an over-reliance of early
history as a main part of the culture of a group like amateur radio. An
article by the [Thought Lab] says the following about it.

[Thought Lab]: https://www.thoughtlab.com/blog/how-history-will-fuel-your-business/#:~:text=So%2C%20how%20can%20businesses%20use,and%20find%20inspiration%20for%20innovation.

#### How an overemphasis on history reduces innovation

* **Risk aversion**: When experienced professionals rely too heavily on
"how we've always done it," they become hesitant to venture into
the unknown. The fear of failure can stop the pursuit of unconventional,
and potentially groundbreaking, ideas.

* **Limiting frames of reference**: Extensive experience and historical
precedent can create a mental model of what is possible, making
it difficult to conceive of entirely new possibilities. In this
environment, alternatives and fresh perspectives are often overlooked.

* **False confidence in expertise**: A deep knowledge of the past
can create an "illusion of expertise" that leads to overconfidence.
This mindset can close people off to new information and different
approaches, stunting creative growth.

* **Subconscious bias against novelty**: Research has shown that many
leaders have an unconscious bias toward familiar, established solutions,
especially when motivated to reduce uncertainty. This bias can cause
them to reject new ideas, even if they outwardly claim to want creative
thinking.

* **Misguided strategic choices**: As seen in Soviet technology policy,
an incorrect assumption about the historical trajectory of innovation
can lead to big, irreversible bets on the wrong path. Instead of
building on existing strengths, leaders may shift their focus toward an
ineffective strategy, weakening their own sector.

#### How a balanced understanding of history promotes innovation

* **Learning from past successes and failures**: By studying the history
of an industry, innovators can see what has worked and what has not.
This prevents the repetition of past mistakes and allows for the
identification of successful strategies that can be applied in new
contexts.

* **Understanding complex origins**: History reveals that modern innovations
are often built upon a long lineage of prior technologies and
discoveries. This understanding gives innovators context for where
to focus their efforts and avoids a simplistic or misleading view of
progress.

* **Questioning assumptions**: Historical perspective allows innovators to
question entrenched narratives and conventional wisdom. It helps them
re-evaluate their beliefs by comparing them to a wide range of past
scenarios, which can lead to new insights.

* **Gaining resilience**: Studying how past innovators and companies
overcame challenges can inspire a more resilient approach to obstacles.
Instead of seeing setbacks as reasons to give up, they are viewed as a
necessary part of the journey.

* **Revealing long-term impacts**: History helps put the ethical ambiguities
of new technologies into perspective. By observing the unintended
consequences of past innovations, creators can better consider the
potential long-term risks and societal impacts of their work.

Readers can identify these issues within the hobby by just reading and
listening for a bit. National and local organizations are legion for
this "we have always done it this way." Witness the ARRL Sections
which arose when one of the Founders (Maxim) was organizing regional
bodies to pass messages. Is this not a Spark Gap in the rearview mirror
today? This geography to serve amateur radio in the United States is
almost ludicrous. See also [Onno's article] on changing the current
culture in amateur radio. I could go on but this is a family-rated blog,
lol.

### What can we do about this demographic transition in our culture?

How can amateur radio more effectively deal with the shackles of a
**fossilized culture where tradition rules innovation?** Do we need the
Spark Gap in our rearview mirror as a guidepost? Let's just acknowledge
that no amateur could sit down at a workbench and design and build a
modern transceiver! Take a Kenwood TS-590SG. It's far from the leading
edge. But could you design one? Then build that design? I couldn't. **Why
would we?** As Rob Sherwood has written (and [I have analyzed]), we have the
best receivers that we have ever had in the current market. Even though
purchasing semi-homebrew radios, like the BitX variety (and I have),
push hams toward tinkering, they are not "production" quality for many
ham radio activities---like contesting, DXing, and so forth. Yes, some
do spend most of their time in tinker-mode rather than production-mode.
What [we know from Canada] is that we have strong segments in "production
mode" activities as well as segments in experimentation where homebrew
radios have a better use-case for the population. Should we pressure all
newbies toward the past when getting them interested in the present and
future? My friend, Dan KB6NU, [just wrote about this same topic][kb6nu].

[kb6nu]: https://www.kb6nu.com/what-chatgpt-would-do-to-attract-young-people-to-amateur-radio/

Yes, I built a crystal radio as a young teen, using the Fox Hole model
with a pencil lead, razor, toilet paper roll for the coil, and so forth.
Led the building of an FM and AM station as well. Learned a lot. I still
build a lot of things. These activities are highly useful as educational
tools. But we must face that we are appliance operators today due to
the sophistication of the technology. At best, we are ***appliance
enhancers*** by homebrewing accessories, modifying "appliance" radios,
and so ` forth. (Hear my interview segment with Ray Novak of Icom
America on the [ICQ Podcast] where I coined this term.) Yes, some do
build and operate fully homebrew rigs. Bill Meara N2CQR of [Solder
Smoke] comes quickly to mind. Nothing detrimental with that per se but
should we have a norm that every ham should follow suit? When we get
the Spark Gap out of our rearview mirror as a guidepost for the future,
we will make much more progress with post-Baby Boomers for reasons I've
outlined above.
