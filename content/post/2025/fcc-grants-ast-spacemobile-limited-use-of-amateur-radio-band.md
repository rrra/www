[IARU reports] the FCC has granted AST SpaceMobile limited use of the
430--440 MHz amateur radio band. The license grants use of amateur
radio spectrum for emergency purposes only.

>On August 29th, 2025, the FCC Space Bureau did grant a license to AST
>& Science LLC (operating as AST Space Mobile) for using the 430--440
>MHz amateur radio allocation for TT&C[^1] operations for 20 additional
>satellites.

IARU relays that the volume of comments filed by amateur radio
organizations and operators contributed to the limited grant by the FCC
Space Bureau. IARU continues to maintain that AST SpaceMobile has failed
to show a legitimate need to utilize amateur radio spectrum.
