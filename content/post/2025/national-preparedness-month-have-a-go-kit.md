September is National Preparedness Month, and ARRL is working to help
radio amateurs have a plan for family resilience. Many hams enjoy public
service as part of their operating. Being ready to activate for a served
agency through the ARRL Amateur Radio Emergency Service&reg; (ARES&reg;)
involves not only being licensed and trained, but also prepared and
equipped.

ARRL Director of Emergency Management Josh Johnston, KE5MHV, suggests
that hams and their families have a "go-bag". He says there are
a few things to consider: "You need to be able to function while
activated, so that means you need a kit for your needs and a kit for
your radio needs. If your family is impacted by the situation, they also
need to have some gear at the ready."

On the ARRL website, there's an [Emergency Prep Kit Checklist][list]. It
lists the common items such as food and water for several days, a first
aid kit, medications, chargers for your devices and other useful items.

Having a kit for your radio is useful as well. "Go kits will vary
based on function and need for the field," said Johnston. "Most kits
should include a dual band HT and/or mobile radio with antenna, a power
supply and all necessary cables and connectors. Every kit should include
note pad or paper of some type as well as pens or pencils. You should
have a power source and power cables. If you are working HF then you
will need an HF radio and antenna, and if you want digital capabilities,
then a computer with software preloaded will be desired."

Other things you may want will include tape and tools, spare batteries,
headphones, flashlights of some sort, cell phone chargers, and a
multimeter. Other items that won't fit in a bag but may be needed
include a generator, a working surface like a small folding table, a
chair, and some type of shelter.

Need a bag for your go kit? Consider the [ARRL Gray Canvas
Backpack][pack]. $30.00 in the ARRL Store.
