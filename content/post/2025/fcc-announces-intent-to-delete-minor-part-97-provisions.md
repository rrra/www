As part of a [much larger overhaul focused on deleting almost 400
obsolete wireless regulations][400], the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) has announced plans to delete or modify four minor
provisions of Part 97.

ARRL's Washington Counsel has reviewed the proposal and agrees that
the deletions are to obsolete rules and will have no impact on today's
modern Amateur Radio Service. One of the [deletions was suggested by
ARRL][del] as part of an earlier FCC request for public input on rules
ripe for deletion.

The proposed regulatory changes are to:

1. **Delete &sect; [97.27]**. This provision relates to the FCC's right
to modify station licenses. The Commission rationale for deletion is
that it duplicates Section 316 of the Communications Act. Its deletion
will result in no substantive change to the right of the FCC to modify a
station license.

2. **Delete &sect; [97.29]**. This provision specified the procedure to
replace paper licenses. The FCC stopped producing paper licenses at
the end of 2020, having implemented a system that allows any licensee
to download license originals using the password-protected area of the
FCC's ULS computer database system that is web-accessible. The ARRL
proposed deleting this section in comments filed earlier this year.

3. **Delete &sect; [97.315] (b)(2)**. This provision grandfathered
HF amplifiers purchased before April 28, 1978 by an amateur radio
operator for use at that operator's station and also grandfathered those
manufactured before April 28, 1978 for which a marketing waiver was
issued. The applicability of this rule has long passed.

4. **Delete &sect; [97.521](b) and [Appendix 2]**. This rule and appendix
relate to VEC regions, which were based on the traditional amateur call
sign areas. The FCC no longer limits VECs to regions and there is no
reason for doing so given the nature of remote exams.

[Appendix 2]: https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/47/appendix-2_to_part_97

"[Direct Final Rule][dfr]" proceedings such as this are limited to rules
that are no longer applicable because they have sunset by operation of
law; govern an expired event; regulate an obsolete technology; regulate
virtually a null set of FCC licensees; regulate an outdated market
structure; or otherwise are no longer used in practice or otherwise in
the public interest. The deletions will become effective 60 days after
publication in the Federal Register unless the Commission finds that
adverse comments filed within 20 days of publication raise significant
issues that merit additional consideration.

ARRL will continue to engage with the FCC in the regulatory and
rulemaking process as part of our mission to promote and protect the
art, science, and enjoyment of amateur radio, and to develop the next
generation of radio amateurs.
