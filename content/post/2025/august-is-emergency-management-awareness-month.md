August is [Emergency Management Awareness Month][month], and Cass County is proud
to highlight the vital role emergency managers play in preparing for and
responding to disasters and emergenciesâ€”while also welcoming a new
face to lead those efforts locally.

This year marks the first-ever National Emergency Management Awareness
Month, launched by the U.S. Council of the International Association
of Emergency Managers ([IAEM-USA]). The nationwide initiative shines a
spotlight on the profession of emergency management, promoting a better
understanding of the work emergency managers do to keep communities safe
and resilient.

Cass County is taking this opportunity to not only raise awareness but
also introduce the community to its newly appointed Emergency Manager,
Cole Baker.

"Emergency Management Awareness Month is a great way for the community
to engage with the Emergency Manager - and for the Manager to engage
with the community. When it comes to disaster management we are all in
this together," Baker said.

Emergency managers serve as the behind-the-scenes coordinators before,
during, and after disasters---from floods and blizzards to large
public events. They work closely with first responders, public health,
government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and private businesses to
ensure communities are ready for anything.

Throughout August, Cass County Emergency Management encourages residents
and community partners to learn more about what emergency management is,
how they can be better prepared, and how to get involved.
