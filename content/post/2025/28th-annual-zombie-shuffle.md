### About the Zombie Shuffle

>THE ZOMBIE SHUFFLE is an annual afternoon/evening event for QRPers to
>get on the air, have some fun, and rack up a really big score in spite
>of what your CW or operating skills may be. It is held the Friday
>nearest Halloween each year and to avoid the ARRL CW Sweepstakes
>contest.
>
>Afternoon start time to take advantage of the higher bands before
>nightfall.
>
>The Zombie Shuffle is administered strictly through the [QRP-L mailing
>list][list] and [the Zombie Shuffle Rules page][site].
>
>The First Zombie Shuffle was held on Oct. 30, 1998 with the launch of
>the NorCal-20 QRP transceiver kit. [^1]

#### Zombie Event Philosophy

>There is no point to the Zombie Shuffle whatsoever except to get on
>the air and have some goofy fun with fellow Zombies and QRPers. Even
>with only 2-3 QSOs, you can earn a fairly large score to brag to your
>co-workers and QRO buddies. If you haven't been on the air for awhile,
>or you are a new CW ham, your fist is “rusty,” or your code speed
>is slow, this is the “contest” to put a few contacts in the log.
>Note that the scoring is based largely on SERENDIPITY rather than
>operating skill. Band conditions and propagation are not the best at
>night, so operators are not cracking out 35wpm. Around 13-18 wpm is
>typical. Don't be afraid to ask a station to QRS (slow down) or to
>repeat their exchange if you miss it. Most will match your speed.
>They want to work you as much as you want to work them. And remember,
>they're a Zombie too! We want you to stay on the air and have fun in
>spite of crummy bands – so you can work the same station on a band
>after a two hour wait (every 2 hours if you wish). So get out your
>straight key, keyer, bug, or spark gap and do your CW thing.
>
>Every year, we get summary sheets from a few that says "These were my
>first CW QSOs ever," or "my first CW contacts in 20 years." It's an
>honor to give a ham their first CW QSOs. That's what it's all about. [^2]
