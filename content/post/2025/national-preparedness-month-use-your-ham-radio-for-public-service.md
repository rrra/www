Amateur radio has long been a vital partner with served agencies in
providing communications support, passing traffic, and performing other
tasks, both in times of crisis and in times of community service.
Through community events, hams help out before and When All Else
Fails&reg;.

The best way to become a part of serving the greater good in your area
is by joining your local ARRL Amateur Radio Emergency Service® (ARES®)
group. "Every disaster starts and ends at the local level, and so
should community resilience through radio," said ARRL Director of
Emergency Management Josh Johnston, KE5MHV. "Local ARES groups are set
up based on the needs of the local community and local volunteers are
gritical to making sure they are able to serve when needed."

[ARRL The National Association for Amateur Radio&reg;][arrl] has a tool
to help hams get plugged in with a group near them. An interactive map
at [www.arrl.org/find-an-ares-group][find] will let those interested in
serving connect with local leadership. This [flyer] [PDF] talks about
what ARES does at the local level.

As September ends, the lessons from National Preparedness Month
shouldn’t stop with the change of the calendar. As ARRL Sections
prepare for the Simulated Emergency Test (SET) in October, being a
trained member of a local ARES group will add to your personal, family,
and community resilience.
