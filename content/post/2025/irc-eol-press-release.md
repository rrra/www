**The international reply coupon enters the history books**

15 December (Berne, Switzerland) --- Since its introduction on 1
October 1907, the international reply coupon ([IRC]) has accompanied
generations of correspondents, travellers and collectors across the
world. Serving as a truly universal paper currency, it enables the
holder to pay for postage of an unregistered international airmail
letter between the UPU’s 192 member countries. For almost 120 years
and across 10 successive models, the IRC has embodied the values of
universality, fairness and solidarity upon which the universal postal
service is founded.

On 17 September 2025, at the 28th Universal Postal Congress in Dubai
(United Arab Emirates), the UPU member countries decided, with a view
to adapting and simplifying the universal services, to discontinue the
IRC as of 31 December 2026. This decision is a natural progression
within the broader transformation of international postal services,
in alignment with the digital practices and modern outlook of their
customers.

The UPU International Bureau is proud to provide support in this
transition and is currently working towards the IRC’s transformation
into a part of the UPU’s heritage, in keeping with its history and
unique role in global postal cooperation. IRCs will remain valid and
available for sale by and exchange with the designated opera­tors of
UPU member countries until 31 December 2026.

Lastly, in celebration of the exceptional legacy of the IRC, a special
commemorative product will be released. Tracing the history of the IRC
and offering an unprecedented customer experience, this product will
honour this iconic page in the history of philately and the UPU.
