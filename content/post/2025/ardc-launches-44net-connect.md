[ARDC] has launched [44Net Connect], a new portal designed to make it easier
for ham radio operators to gain access to and experiment with subnets
of the 44.0.0.0/8 IP address space.
<!--more-->

Through the portal, hams can apply for VPN access to [44Net] which
comes with a dedicated 44Net IP address. Tunnel services are provided
through [WireGuard] with options to add IP networks and autonomous
system numbers. Proof of ham radio license is required.

Hams can get started at https://connect.44net.cloud/. An overview of
44Net is available on the [44Net Wiki].
