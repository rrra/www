Back in 2021, I was working with a young ham looking to learn Morse
code. As he was blind, many of the tools commonly used, were not as
useful. I stumbled upon the [Morserino-32], a wonderful device from
Willi OE1WKL, I bought a pair of them in kit form, and soon had my young
fella sending and receiving Morse.

Recently a somewhat older ham (about 70 years older than my young
student) mentioned he was having issues transitioning from CW skills
learned on a bug decades ago to modern paddles/keyers. I immediately
though of the "Echo Trainer" mode in the Morserino-32, which had
been boxed up for the past 5 years. Upon examining one of them, I
discovered that the 3.7v [LiPo battery] had "[puffed]". This is a sign
of a failed battery.

Since many ham devices use LiPo batteries, I thought I would remind
folks to beware [of] puffed batteries. It is quite dangerous to attempt to
charge and use them. The photo below shows the puffed battery on the
left (leads cut off since it can't be used) and a "normal" battery
on the right. If it looks like a pillow, it is time to dispose of it
safely & properly. Both Best Buy and Staples offer battery recycling for
free.
