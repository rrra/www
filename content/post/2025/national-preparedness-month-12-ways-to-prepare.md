September is [National Preparedness Month][npm], and ARRL is working to arm
members with knowledge and resources to be resilient in the face of
disaster. Amateur radio serves as a powerful tool and national resource
before and [When All Else Fails&reg;][fails], but being prepared goes beyond radio.
<!--more-->

"Being ready to serve your community through ham radio begins with
being ready yourself," says ARRL Director of Emergency Management Josh
Johnston, KE5MHV. Johnston spent 17 years as a county emergency manager
before coming to lead programs such as the ARRL Amateur Radio Emergency
Service&reg; (ARES&reg;). "Having a plan and preparing yourself will improve
your chances of being resilient in the face of disaster."

ARES works closely with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA),
which has shared this checklist of [12 ways to prepare][12ways] [PDF]:

* Sign up for alerts and warnings
* Make a plan
* Save for a rainy day
* Practice emergency drills
* Test family communication plan
* Safeguard documents 
* Plan with neighbors
* Make your home safer
* Know evacuation routes
* Assemble or update supplies
* Get involved in your community
* Document and insure property
