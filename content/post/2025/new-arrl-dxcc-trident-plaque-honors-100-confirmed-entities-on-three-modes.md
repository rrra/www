[ARRL The National Association for Amateur Radio&reg;][arrl] announces
the [DXCC&reg; Trident plaque][trident], a new award to honor the
accomplishments of radio amateurs who have confirmed contacts with at
least 100 ARRL DXCC award entities on each of three modes: phone, CW,
and digital. The plaque is endorsable at levels of 200, 300, and Honor
Roll, based on achieving that level on ***all three modes*** at the time
of application.

ARRL Radiosport and Regulatory Affairs Manager Bart Jahnke, W9JJ, says
the new award should be exciting to hams. "It gives all participants
of the DXCC program, especially those new to DXCC, something fresh to
work towards," he said. ARRL has long had the Worked All States Triple
Play award, but this introduces the multi-mode achievement to the DXCC
program.

Confirmation of QSOs toward DXCC Trident is done only through the
standard process by credits within the ARRL DXCC program via Logbook of
The World&reg; (LoTW&reg;). No QSL cards will be accepted with a plaque order.
If your DXCC credits are not already visible in LoTW, you must first
link your DXCC and LoTW profiles by requesting a credit merge from the
[ARRL Awards Desk][desk]

The earliest QSO date, and starting date for the DXCC Trident award, is
November 1, 1976, when RTTY (now included with all digital QSOs) DXCC
was introduced.

Additional details for determining eligibility and instructions
for ordering a DXCC Trident plaque are included at
[www.arrl.org/dxcc-trident-award][trident]. The plaque is issued by
completing the official DXCC Item Order Form which will be used by the
ARRL Awards Department to verify eligibility. Plaque prices include
shipping and handling and are subject to change without notice. All
prices are in US dollars: shipped to US addresses $95; to Canada $114;
to other international $134.

Celebrate your achievement and dedication to the DXCC program across all
modes with the ARRL DXCC Trident award --- a symbol of excellence in
amateur radio operating and DXing.
