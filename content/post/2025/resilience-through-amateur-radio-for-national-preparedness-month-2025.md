September is [National Preparedness Month][npm], which is a good time
to look at your personal, family, and community resilience levels. For
2025, the National Preparedness Month theme is "Preparedness Starts at
Home."

Amateur radio is a valuable resource for communication and community
service before and during times of crisis, and can be a significant
factor in your home's level of preparedness.

"Now is the time to make sure everything is in order," said ARRL
Director of Emergency Management Josh Johnston, KE5MHV.

For hams, it means taking the time to check their equipment---from
the ground to the antenna, so that it is ready. "Many hams already
participate in daily, weekly, and monthly nets that help them hone their
communication skills, but if you're not already active in one, this
could be a good opportunity to get into it," said Johnston.

To extend your personal preparedness into helping provide community
resilience, Johnston invites operators to become active in their
local [ARRL Amateur Radio Emergency Service&reg;][ares] (ARES&reg;)
activities. "ARES has been leveraging the utility value of the Amateur
Radio Service for 90 years," he said. "We saw last year during Hurricane
Helene how vital of a lifeline ham radio operators were for the affected
areas."

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [is predicting
an above-normal 2025 Atlantic hurricane season][predict].

Hurricane Watch Net (HWN) Manager Bobby Graves, KB5HAV, says that should
motivate hams, but not scare them. "Never let your guard down," said
Graves. "Don't live your life in fear, just be aware." Graves
added that his net operators are spread across the Western Hemisphere,
but they still have training sessions via radio nets and Zoom meetings.
