### About ND Statehood Day {#ndsd}

>On November 2, 1989 the Dakota Territory was divided into two states,
>North Dakota and South Dakota, both of which were admitted to the
>Union. The Dakotas observe the anniversary of this event as Statehood
>Day, although it is not a public holiday in either of the states.
>
>The region that is now the Dakotas had been inhabited by Native
>American
>peoples for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans. It was
>named after the Dakota people; the word "Dakota" is translated from
>their native language as "ally". [^1] 

>A brief [historical overview] of the state up to 1989 ... was written by
>Larry Remele (Education & Interpretation Division, State Historical
>Society of North Dakota) for the 1989 *North Dakota Blue Book*, a
>publication of the North Dakota Secretary of State.
>
>A short history of North Dakota is also available through the [American
>Memories Project][amp] at the Library of Congress site. [^2]
