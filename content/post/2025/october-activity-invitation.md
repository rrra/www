### About LICW

>The Long Island CW Club had been started in 2018 to promote and expand
>the use of Morse Code (CW) amongst amateur radio operators, initially
>in our geographic area. Today there is no longer a FCC requirement to
>learn CW to obtain an amateur radio license. Yet we find there is still
>a pent up demand to learn the code, become more proficient at it and
>to take part in activities centered around this interesting skill. To
>help fill this void, we have put together a group of dedicated teachers
>of Morse Code (CW). We conduct CW training classes via internet video
>conference classes at various skill levels. We have grown quickly,
>branching out with members nationwide and overseas. Please see our
>[Calendar] for CW class times. Besides Morse Code classes, we are very
>active with regular *brick and mortar* activities worldwide such as QRP
>outings, portable operations, museum and hamfest visits and luncheons.
>We also hold regular presentations on a variety of ham radio and Morse
>Code (CW) related topics, also by internet video conference. [^2]
