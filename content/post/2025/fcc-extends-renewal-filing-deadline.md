Although filings that were due during the 2025 Federal Government
shutdown---which ended November 17, 2025---were deemed as due by
November 18, 2025, the Amateur Radio service is one of a small group of
exceptions:

>For personal radio licensees (i.e., Amateur, Ship, Aircraft, GMRS,
>and Commercial Operator Licenses), renewal filings originally due on
>October 1, 2025, through and including March 5, 2026, are now due on
>March 5, 2026. Further, we confirm that licensees whose licenses have
>expired and whose renewal filing deadlines have been extended above
>may rely on their timely renewal filing (by the extended deadline)
>to support continued operation pursuant to section 1.62 of the
>Commission's rules. [^2]

Amateur Radio operators whose license became due for renewal between
October 1, 2025 and November 17, 2025, are strongly encouraged to [file
their renewal][renew] as soon a possible. A [license renewal walkthrough
video][video] is available for RRRA members on the club's groupware server.

There is a discussion in a [recent ARRL News article][article] about
the sporadic system outages affecting renewal during the resumption of
license processing by the FCC.
