National Preparedness Month---also known as September Safety Month or
Disaster Preparedness Month---is an annual campaign held in September.
It is dedicated to empowering individuals, families, businesses, and
communities with the knowledge and resources they need to respond to and
recover from emergencies.

### History of National Preparedness Month

The origin of National Preparedness Month can be traced back to the
tragic events and aftermath of September 11, 2001. Following these
events, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) recognized
the critical need for increased emergency preparedness. FEMA then
collaborated with various partners to launch the National Preparedness
Month campaign in 2004.

National Preparedness Month gained momentum in 2006 when FEMA and the
Ad Council developed the “Ready” campaign. The campaign offered
powerful messaging and widespread reach, playing a significant role
in educating and motivating Americans to prepare for emergencies. It
contributed to the overall goal of National Preparedness Month.

Since its start, National Preparedness Month has evolved into a
collaborative effort among government agencies, nonprofits, schools,
businesses, and communities. The combined efforts guarantee that
everyone is included and part of a more significant effort to promote
preparedness.

During National Preparedness Month, events like emergency preparedness
workshops, community emergency response drills, educational resources,
and preparedness guides are available to help people better prepare.
It’s also a great time for organizations to explore [workplace safety
topics][wst] such as CPR, first aid, and AED training---critical skills
that empower teams to respond confidently when disaster strikes.
Here’s how you can get prepared during National Preparedness Month and
be ready when disaster strikes.

### Learn CPR and First Aid

Knowing CPR and first aid helps you recognize the signs that someone
needs help and the skills to tend to them. CPR and first aid
training skills are important for individual and community emergency
preparedness—these lifesaving skills allow you to make informed
decisions and increase survival rates. During an emergency, CPR and
first aid training help you in various ways.

* **Act swiftly**. In an emergency, every minute counts. Knowing CPR
allows you to act swiftly and provide lifesaving support to a person
during cardiac arrest. For injuries like life-threatening bleeding,
burns or fractures, first aid training encourages you to stabilize the
victim and prevent their condition from getting worse.

* **Protect the community**. During natural disasters or large-scale
emergencies, medical help might not be immediately available. Knowing
and providing CPR and first aid increases the community’s resilience
and readiness to handle the situation.

* **Prevent complications**. Administering first aid helps to prevent
infections, reduce pain, and alleviate the severity of the injury.
Consider a broken bone—knowing how to immobilize the fracture may
help to prevent skeletal, neurological and soft tissue damage. In a
cardiac arrest, administering CPR may reduce the risk of brain damage or
disability and can triple the chance of survival.

Being prepared for an emergency means not just knowing what to do
but how to do it. Learn CPR and first aid this Preparedness Month so
you’re ready for whatever emergency may arise.
