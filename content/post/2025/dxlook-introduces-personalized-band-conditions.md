DXLook, the real-time HF propagation and reception platform used by
amateur radio operators worldwide, has introduced a new feature:
Personalized Band Conditions.
<!--more-->

This update enhances how operators understand HF propagation by
tailoring band condition estimates to each user’s specific grid
location. Rather than relying solely on global indices such as SFI,
A-index, or K-index, DXLook now provides location-aware predictions that
consider geographic position, local time, and atmospheric factors.

"Global space weather numbers are valuable," said Rodrigo Vazquez,
creator of DXLook. "But what matters most to operators is what’s
happening right now at their own QTH. Personalized Band Conditions
bridge that gap."

The new system recognizes that propagation can differ greatly between
regions --- for example, auroral absorption at high latitudes, heavy
static noise in tropical zones, or nighttime D-layer changes at
mid-latitudes. By factoring in these local influences, DXLook offers
more relevant, real-world guidance for operators planning contacts.

The feature is now available on dxlook.com and integrates seamlessly
with the existing band condition widget.
