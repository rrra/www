**Continues Amateur Use of Four Additional 60-Meter Channels and
Updates 420 MHz Coordination Information**

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on December 9, 2025,
released a long-awaited [Report and Order] adopting a new amateur
radio spectrum allocation in the 60-meter band that was approved
for world-wide use on a secondary basis in the WRC-15 (World
Radiocommunication Conference 2015) *[Final Acts]*. The Commission
also agreed with a petition from [ARRL] The National Association for
Amateur Radio® to continue to allow amateur operations on four existing
60-meter channels outside the international allocation with a full 100
watts. **The new rules will go into effect 30 days after publication
in the Federal Register, when amateurs may then begin using the
allocation.**

Specifically, the Commission allocated 5351.5 - 5366.5 kHz (60 meters)
to the amateur service **on a secondary basis with a permitted power of
9.15 watts ERP**. The Commission also authorized amateurs to continue
using four existing channels outside of the 5351.5 - 5366.5 kHz band
centered on 5332, 5348, 5373, and 5405 kHz on a secondary basis with a
permitted power of 100 watts ERP. There are no antenna restrictions but
antenna gain must be used to calculate ERP.

The 60-meter allocation is available to amateurs holding a General Class
or above license. The maximum permissible signal bandwidth is 2.8 kHz.

Amateurs are cautioned that this allocation is strictly on a secondary
basis, and amateurs must avoid interfering with non-amateur stations
using this spectrum. This obligation includes the responsibility to
monitor for such stations using appropriate receiver bandwidths. The FCC
emphasized that "allowing amateur operations in this band while fully
protecting incumbent primary Federal operations is our priority, and
even intermittent interference in this band could jeopardize important
Federal operations."

The Commission left open [ARRL's 2017 Petition for
Rulemaking][petition] to implement this WRC allocation (RM-11785),
stating that "we expect the Commission may address any necessary
power adjustments for the new 15 kilohertz international allocation
in that proceeding." ARRL will be observing operations in the new
band to evaluate the effect of the 9.15-watt limit and already has
been monitoring the regulations and experiences of amateurs in other
countries.

Finally, in the same Report and Order, the FCC updated 420 -- 450 MHz
coordination and contact information for geographic areas where the peak
envelope power (PEP) of amateur stations operating is generally limited
to 50 watts. There was no substantive change to the areas covered by the
power limitation.
