Radio amateurs are valuable resources to their communities in times
of crisis. This week, hams in Connecticut [were featured in news
coverage][news] as they participated in a mass casualty drill with St.
Vincent Medical Center in Bridgeport. Several scenarios played out in
which amateur radio volunteers helped the hospital connect with other
medical facilities, including a targeted cyberattack, mass shooting, and
explosions.

While radio can provide resilience to communities, preparedness for
those who would operate the radios begins at home. During National
Preparedness Month, ARRL is sharing resources from the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) on how to be prepared.

The starting point for building your own resilience is to understand
what threats you face in your area. On the website [www.ready.gov],
there are tools to learn what disasters are most likely to impact your
specific area and how to prepare for them.

ARRL Director of Emergency Management Josh Johnston, KE5MHV, says a
plan should be tailored to threats you're likely to face. "While
we should all be ready for anything --- there are going to be threats
specific to a region. Everyone should be well aware of the events that
happen in your area," he said.

There is additional information on the FEMA website to learn
about region-specific disasters such as hurricanes. Radio
amateurs are encouraged to find an ARES group in their area at
[www.arrl.org/ares][ares].
