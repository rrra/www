ARRL has launched a nationwide grassroots campaign aimed at securing the
passage of federal legislation that would grant Amateur Radio Operators
the same rights to install antennas on their property as those enjoyed
by users of TV antennas, wireless internet, and flagpoles.
<!--more-->

The campaign, announced in an [ARRL Member Bulletin] on September 17,
2025, follows the reintroduction of the *Amateur Radio Emergency
Preparedness Act* in February 2025 (see [ARRL News 02/07/2025]). The
bipartisan bills---[H.R.1094] in the House and [S.459] in the Senate---are
designed to prevent restrictive homeowners’ association (HOA) rules
that currently prohibit or severely limit the installation of amateur
radio antennas, even when such antennas are hidden in trees, placed in
attics, mounted on vehicles, or look like flagpoles.

**"This legislation is about restoring equal rights to licensed Amateur
Radio operators,"** said ARRL President Rick Roderick. **"These
restrictions hinder not only the enjoyment of Amateur Radio, but also
its vital role in emergency communication during disasters."**

### Public Support Needed for Passage

To advance the legislation, ARRL is calling on its members and all
licensees of the US Amateur Radio Service to take action by sending
letters to their congressional representatives. Through a dedicated
online tool at https://send-a-letter.org/hoa/, hams can easily generate
and submit pre-drafted letters with a few clicks.

**Go to---https://send-a-letter.org/hoa/---and help us by sending your
letters to your Representative and Senators.**

ARRL has emphasized that every letter matters. "Your Representative
and Senators need to know that the passage of this legislation is
important to you."
