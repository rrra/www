Hams interested in experimenting with Winlink Global Radio Email&reg; can once
again take advantage of the weekly FediFridayWinlinkNet.
<!--more-->

This net is coordinated through the *Fediverse* (e.g. [Mastodon]) but is open
to all interested amateur radio operators.

The general procedure---subject to change going forward---is to send
a Winlink message to the tactical callsign **FFWN** on Friday between
0000Z and 2359Z in this format:

```
To: FFWN
Subject: check-in
Message body line1: [callsign], [firstname], [city],
[state/province/locale], [country], [mastodon username], [VHF/HF/APRS/Telnet]
Message body line2: [an open question determined by each week's NCS]
Message body line3: Do you agree to have your callsign shared in the check-in list? [Y or N/opt-out]
```
 Check-in messages may be sent via any method supported
by the Winlink system: HF, VHF, APRS, Telnet, ... 

Details for each weekly net are posted on Mastodon shortly before
0000 UTC on Friday and may be found by searching for, or following, the
[#FediFridayWinlinkNet] or [#FFWN] hashtags on any instance.

A Mastodon account is not required to search for net details, but will
enable *out of band* interaction with the other net participants. Visit
[joinmastodon.org] to learn more about joining Mastodon and for a list
of apps.

Results for each weekly net are posted on the
[W0RMT #FediFridayWinlinkNet page](https://w0rmt.net/ffwn/)

Hams who are looking for more Winlink activity may also wish to participate in
the weekly [WinlinkWednesday] nets.
